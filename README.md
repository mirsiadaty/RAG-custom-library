A notable collection of Bulgarian poems is "<xref href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2790\">христо ботев, стихотворения</xref>" by Khristo Botev. This work contains poems written during Bulgaria's struggle for independence from Ottoman rule in the late 19th century. It explores themes of patriotism, sacrifice, and national identity, including renowned pieces like "On Parting" and "The Hanging of Vassil Levski." The text is available in Bulgarian via Project Gutenberg.

No other Bulgarian poetry collections were found in the provided factual statements.
